# Lab 01 – Prerequisites

## Goal
Establish the prerequisites, assumptions, and working principles for this project so it can be followed safely and consistently.

This lab does not deploy any AWS resources.

## Prerequisites
Before starting the technical labs, you should have:

- An active AWS account
- Basic familiarity with AWS concepts (VPC, IAM, EC2)
- Willingness to learn by building and documenting

## Working Principles
The following principles apply throughout this project:

- No secrets or credentials will be hardcoded in code or repositories
- AWS IAM roles and least privilege will be used wherever possible
- Every lab must produce documentation or evidence
- Decisions will be explained, not just implemented
- The project is designed to simulate real-world cloud security scenarios
