# Project Overview – SecretShield

## What this project is
SecretShield is a step-by-step AWS cloud security project focused on building hands-on skills in secrets management, identity and access management, threat detection, and incident response.

This project builds on a completed 3-tier AWS infrastructure project and goes deeper into security-focused design and operations.

## Why this project exists
Modern cloud security incidents often begin with compromised credentials or exposed secrets. This project is designed to understand how those incidents occur and how to prevent, detect, and respond to them using AWS-native controls.

The goal is hands-on learning through building, documenting, and validating security controls in a real AWS environment.

## How this project is structured
This repository is organized as a guided lab series. Each lab:
- explains the goal
- provides step-by-step actions
- specifies evidence to capture
- links to the next lab

This allows others to follow the project from start to finish.

Status: This project is actively in progress and will be updated as the next stages are completed.
